      <p>Foundations of Cybersecurity (CY2550) is the class I have been most excited about thus far. For once, instead of studying cybersecurity on my own and trying to figure out how to navigate the mass of information out there, I would be given structure- a clear learning path. Though I feel I didn’t learn a lot of new concepts, it was a great reinforcement of my previous knowledge. The genuinely fun assignments made me excited to continue progressing through the cyber program.</p>
<p>Below is an overview of my key takeaways from the course.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cybersecurity arguably traces its origins to the 1970s, the golden age of phreaking</li>
<li>ARPANET → The Orange Book → Computer Fraud and Abuse Act → More secure protocols → Internet becomes privatized → Internet rapidly grows, is insecure, and unprepared for such a connected world, leading to the proliferation of several worms, viruses, and attacks</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="threat-modeling">Threat Modeling</h3>
<ol>
<li>Identify your assets</li>
<li>Enumerate attack surfaces</li>
<li>Hypothesize attackers and map them to:
<ol>
<li>Desired value from assets</li>
<li>Ability to target vulnerable surfaces from attack surfaces</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Survey mitigations</li>
<li>Balance cost versus risk</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Various methodologies for threat modeling are available, including: STRIDE, DREAD, OWASP testing framework, PASTA, VAST, and OCTAVE</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cryptography">Cryptography</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>C</strong>onfidentiality, <strong>I</strong>ntegrity, <strong>A</strong>uthenticity, and <strong>N</strong>on-repudiation, are often assured through cryptography</li>
<li>No security through obscurity; Kerchoffs’ Principle and Shannon’s Maxim</li>
<li>One time pads, symmetric key cryptography, block ciphers</li>
<li>Asymmetric cryptography, certificate authorities, Diffie-Hellman basis for protocols with Perfect Forward Secrecy, RSA based on difficulty of factoring the product of primes</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
<ul>
<li>Classes of secrets: something you know (i.e. password), have (i.e. phone), or are (i.e. biometric)</li>
<li>Passwords are often weak enough for brute-force or dictionary attacks, and hash chains can enable time-space efficient reversal of hash functions (but is prone to collisions)
<ul>
<li>Rainbow tables improve on hash chains by using a family of reductions instead of a single reduction to reduce the likelihood of collisions; defeated by salting and key stretching</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Measure password quality with entropy S = log₂N^L; note that length matters more than symbol types</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="access-control">Access Control</h3>
<ul>
<li>Discretionary access control vs. mandatory access control</li>
<li>With setuid, a program may execute as the file owner, rather than executing principal
<ul>
<li>Note: only setuid on compiled binary programs, not scripts, as it can lead to TOCTOU vulnerabilities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A capability-based access control system can fix the confused deputy problem (subject cannot tell which principal it is serving when it performs a write) because selecting a capability also selects a master</li>
<li>Security models: Bell-LaPadula (read down, write up) only address confidentiality while Biba Integrity Model (read up, write down) only addresses integrity</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="social-engineering">Social Engineering</h3>
<ul>
<li>Humans are the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain</li>
<li>Subconscious decision-making reduces cognitive burden, like subconscious cognitive biases including behavioral, social, and memory biases</li>
<li>Social engineering attacks include: baiting, tailgating, scareware, advance-fee scams, phishing or spear phishing
<ul>
<li>Leverage cognitive biases and rely on: information asymmetry, context construction, elicitation. and persuasion</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="systems-security">Systems Security</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hardware support for process isolation with virtual memory and protected mode execution (rings) which stops direct access to devices and allows OS to impose access control checks
<ul>
<li>Base and bound registers, segmentation, and page tables enforce virtual memory</li>
<li>Ring 0: OS → Ring 1, 2: device drivers → Ring 3: userland</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>File access control, anti-virus, firewall, and secure logging</li>
<li>Separation of privilege, least privilege, compromise recording, work factor, authentication rate limiting, open design, economy of mechanism, and complete mediation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exploits">Exploits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cross site scripting can be reflected, stored, or DOM-based, and allows user input to be interpreted as document structure to lead to malicious code execution
<ul>
<li>To mitigate: cookie restrictions, client-side filter, input validation, output filtering</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SQL injections
<ul>
<li>To mitigate: escaping inputs, sanitizing inputs, prepared statements, object-relational mappings, domain-specific languages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In buffer overflow, vulnerability often stems from the fact that low-level languages are not memory safe and control flow information is stored inline with user data on the stack
<ul>
<li>Compiled shellcode that is injected must be zero-clean, and an NOP sled is often built in front of the shellcode</li>
<li>To mitigate: stack canaries (sentinel values before each saved IP), non-executable stacks, address-space layout randomization</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ddos">DDOS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Denial of service achieves scale with volunteers, reflection and amplification, and botnets</li>
<li>Smurfing works because ICMP protocol doesn’t include authentication and the attacker benefits from an amplification factor</li>
<li>To mitigate: anti-amplification, network filters, anti-spoofing, content distribution networks,</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="apt">APT</h3>
<ul>
<li>Generally, cybercriminals are profit-drive, opportunistic, and part of an underground economy while APTs are intelligence and espionage-driven, highly targeted, and highly secretive</li>
<li>Lazarus group, PLA Unit 61398, Fancy Bear, Cozy Bear</li>
<li>Shadow brokers, Vault7, Stuxnet</li>
<li>Tallinn manual examined how existing international law applies to online conflict</li>
<li>Hoarding vs. disclosing zero-days and Vulnerabilities Equities Process</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cyberlaw">Cyberlaw</h3>
<ul>
<li>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) of 1986 prohibits accessing a protected computer without authorization; authorization can be defined by policy or by mechanism</li>
<li>Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998 criminalizes circumvention of access controls and the distribution of circumvention tools, regardless of infringing on copyright</li>
<li>CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 enshrines an opt-out, rather than an opt-in system</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="web-privacy">Web Privacy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Online advertising companies, online data brokers, and offline data brokers track you</li>
<li>Stateful identifiers (IP address, cookies, locally shared objects (LSOs), E-tags, etc) and stateless fingerprints (browser and OS version, plugins / extensions, audio and battery, etc)</li>
<li>To mitigate tracking: incognito browsing, VPN, secure browser, delete cookies, localstorage, and cache, ad and tracker blocking extensions, disable JavaScript, uMatrix extension</li>
<li>Subject Access Rights give the ability to see, modify, and delete data collected about you while Affirmative notice and consent is prominent disclosure of collection and ability to opt-out</li>
</ul>
