Draper Labs is a non-profit research and development organization. This was my first time having a real adult job, and I learned a lot about how I want to move forward in the field, and about myself.

      <p>Just finished my first co-op experience: 7 months at Draper Labs as a Cybersecurity Analyst working in the SOC.</p>
<p>Draper Labs is a non-profit research and development organization. This was my first time having a real adult job, and I learned a lot about how I want to move forward in the field, and about myself. I triaged daily alerts from Splunk, Carbon Black, and Proofpoint, which improved my skills in threat analysis, vulnerability management, and incident response. Every day, I resolved tickets for various requests, like specific software installation or VPN exceptions. Every week, I updated and deployed new firewall rules. I helped in efforts to identify insider threats performing sensitive data exfiltration, and deploying a new policy to disallow any unauthorized USB device connections. I was also given tasks directly from the CISO, mostly non-technical ones like writing a report on an emerging threat or summarizing new compliance documentation, but it was exciting to feel so involved.</p>
<p>However, I realized the implementation of cybersecurity in a corporate setting is sometimes different than what I&rsquo;ve learned in the classroom or in textbooks, often because of financial, administrative, or compliance restraints that make progress difficult. In my role, which was mostly about maintenance rather than improvement, I was struggling to find the work satisfying. Hours spent on false positive alerts, and there was no tangible result; no sense of progress that I find fulfilling.</p>
<p>I realized how much I missed programming and building real solutions for an end product, and thankfully my manager understood and gave me several coding projects. I did a lot of work with Tenable’s API to automate vulnerability scanning and parse results, and built a database of network enclave information with a corresponding user-friendly front-end. I enjoyed this work much more. It felt creative and purposeful, as I was actively making security operations more efficient and resilient. Before my co-op, all domains of cybersecurity seemed interesting, but now I was able to narrow my interests to the intersection of cybersecurity and coding, preferably with a strong focus in automation.</p>
<p>Although I realized being an analyst is not for me, I am so grateful towards the CISO, my manager, and the team for all their guidance and support in this experience. In my last conversation with the CISO, I thanked him, told him I hope we cross paths again, and teased that maybe it&rsquo;ll be when I&rsquo;m a CISO too. There&rsquo;s a long way to go&hellip;</p>
